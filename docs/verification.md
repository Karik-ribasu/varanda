# varanda — end-to-end verification

Date: 2026-10-22. Every check below was run on this date on one Mac. Logs and screenshots stayed in the verification session's scratchpad (not committed).

## Machine

| Item | Version |
|---|---|
| macOS | 15.7.3 (24G419) |
| Xcode | 26.2 (17C52) |
| CocoaPods | 1.16.2 |
| Simulator | iPhone 17 Pro, iOS 26.2 |
| Node.js | v26.10.0 |
| npm | 11.19.1 |

## 1. Clean baseline

| Command (repo root) | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `npm ci` | exit 0 |
| `npm run lint` | exit 0 (`standard`, no findings) |
| `npm test` | exit 0: `packages/core` 7 files, `packages/rpc` 8 files, `apps/cli` 14 files, 0 failures, no `not ok` line |
| `npm run demo` | exit 0, `DEMO OK` |
| `node bin/varanda.js help` | exit 0; byte-identical (`cmp`, same SHA-1) to the README "Ajuda" fence |
| `node bin/varanda-serve.js --help` | exit 0; prints the option list |

## 2. iOS gate on the final code

Run after `npm ci` on the current client (recover defaults to true; an IPC that ends on its own terminates the worklet).

```sh
npm run link:addons -w apps/app      # exit 0, rocksdb/udx/sodium/bare-fs linked for every platform
npm run pack:worklet -w apps/app     # 1841105 bytes, 344 files, 38 linked addon entries; node scan clean
(cd apps/app/ios && LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 pod install)   # exit 0
(cd apps/app/ios && xcodebuild -workspace Varanda.xcworkspace -scheme Varanda -configuration Debug \
  -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'name=iPhone 17 Pro' -derivedDataPath build build)   # BUILD SUCCEEDED
xcrun simctl install booted apps/app/ios/build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/Varanda.app
EXPO_PUBLIC_VARANDA_GATE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8790 npx expo start --port 8081 --clear   # from apps/app, no CI=1
npm run gate -- --device booted      # from apps/app, exit 0
```

## 3. Web: export, varanda-serve, member flow in a browser

```sh
cd apps/app && npx expo export --platform web     # "Exported: dist": apps/app/dist
```

Output: `dist/index.html` (1.2 KB), `dist/favicon.ico`, `dist/metadata.json` and one bundle `dist/_expo/static/js/web/index-<hash>.js` (428 KB). The output directory is `apps/app/dist`, as `--ui apps/app/dist` assumes; docs/development.md now says so.

Environment (all on loopback, data under the scratchpad):

```sh
node apps/cli/scripts/local-dht.js --port 49800
# association, seeder key + certificate, CLI member "Carla CLI" (assoc init, seed key,
# assoc certify-seeder, seed cert add, id create, assoc certify, cert add, profile set)
node bin/varanda.js seed --data <env>/seeder --association <assoc> --bootstrap 127.0.0.1:49800 --dht-host 127.0.0.1
node bin/varanda-serve.js --data <env>/web --association <assoc> --bootstrap 127.0.0.1:49800 \
  --dht-host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787 --ui apps/app/dist
```

varanda-serve printed its two lines once (`varanda-serve em http://127.0.0.1:8787`, `abra http://127.0.0.1:8787/#token=...`).

HTTP checks with curl: `/` and the JS bundle answer 200 with the CSP (`default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; ... connect-src 'self' ws://127.0.0.1:8787 ws://localhost:8787; frame-ancestors 'none'; ...`), `nosniff`, `no-referrer`, `DENY` and `no-store`. `Host: evil.com` -> 421, `POST /` -> 405, `/../package.json` (path as is) -> 404, `/qualquer` -> 200 (index.html fallback).

Browser: the built-in browser of the Claude desktop app (Chromium), opened on the printed URL. The page ran under the server's CSP (inline `expo-reset` style allowed by `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`; no CSP error blocked the app). Member flow, all through the UI:

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| Token | After load: `location.href` = `http://127.0.0.1:8787/` (fragment removed), `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` empty, `document.cookie` empty, the token not in the DOM |
| Identidade | "criar identidade" -> key `d28af364...`; association shown |
| Certificate, invalid | another member's certificate (issued by the CLI for the CLI member) -> refused, "certificado inválido (member-mismatch)" |
| Certificate, valid | issued with `node bin/varanda.js assoc certify --member d28af364... --age-band 18+ --method stub` -> "certificado gravado", "certificado de membro: válido" |
| Perfil | "Wanda Web" / "membro pelo navegador" published (Diário #1) |
| Publicar | "ola do navegador (web 1)" (Diário #2) |
| Seguindo | followed the CLI member `de74d3f3...` |
| Sincronizar (uma vez) | `sync ready`, `peer seeder 2ad91b1c`, `admitted d28af364... 0`, `have d28af364... 3`, `downloaded de74d3f3... 3`, then "última execução 1: concluída" |
| A Rua | "Carla CLI · ola do terminal (cli 1)" and the own post |
| Reply | "responder" on the CLI post -> Diário #3 shows "resposta a de74d3f3:2"; A Rua shows the same line on the reply |
| 390 px | viewport 390x844: `scrollWidth` 390 (no horizontal page scroll); cards fit; the tab bar scrolls horizontally by design (`ScrollView horizontal`) |

## 4. Cross-platform P2P matrix (one local DHT, one certified seeder)

Members: the CLI member "Carla CLI" (`de74d3f3...`), the browser member "Wanda Web" (`d28af364...`, the varanda-serve node of section 3) and the iOS simulator member "Iara iPhone" (`5fb284f3...`). The iOS app was the member UI build: the same Debug binary, uninstalled and reinstalled (empty Documents), with Metro started without `EXPO_PUBLIC_VARANDA_GATE_URL` (`npx expo start --port 8081 --clear`, no CI=1). The Conectar screen got the association, bootstrap `127.0.0.1:49800` and DHT host `127.0.0.1`; the certificate was issued by `assoc certify` and typed into Identidade.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Each member posts | CLI `ola do terminal (cli 1)`; web `ola do navegador (web 1)` and a reply to the CLI post; iOS `ola do iPhone (ios 1)` |
| Each follows the other two | CLI `follow` x2; web Seguindo x2 ("2 diários seguidos"); iOS Seguindo x2 |
| Sync, every post in every feed | After `sync --once` (CLI), "sincronizar uma vez" (web, iOS) in turn, the CLI `feed` lists all six posts of the three members (replies shown as `↳ de74d3f3#2` and `↳ d28af364#3`); web A Rua lists the same six; iOS A Rua lists the five posts by the others plus its own |
| Offline post | CLI `post 'feito offline no terminal (cli 2)'` with no sync running, then one `sync --once`: it appeared in iOS A Rua (during iOS's continuous sync; the CLI log shows `peer member 01cfc5b7`, a direct member connection) and in web A Rua after the next web sync |
| Reads and writes during a continuous sync | iOS "sincronizar sempre" (run 2 running), then A Rua (feed.read) and a reply `resposta do iPhone durante sync continuo` (post.reply) succeeded; Diário #3 shows it; the CLI and the web got it on their next sync |
| Force-kill and relaunch iOS | `xcrun simctl terminate` while the continuous sync held the lock, then `launch`: the app went straight to the member UI (saved config), same key `5fb284f3...`, certificate "válido", 2 follows, Diário #0 to #3 intact |
| Invalid certificate | web UI: "certificado inválido (member-mismatch)" (section 3); CLI `cert add` of another member's certificate: `erro: certificado inválido (member-mismatch)`, exit 1. The demo (section 1) also covers `untrusted-association` |

Screenshots: `04-ios-*.png` in the scratchpad.

### Defect found and fixed: smart quotes in the iOS certificate field

Typing the certificate JSON on iOS turned `"` into curly quotes (iOS smart punctuation; `autoCorrect={false}` does not turn it off), and "gravar certificado" answered "JSON inválido" (`04-ios-cert-smartquotes.png`). Pasting is not affected. Fix in `apps/app/src/screens/Identidade.js`: the curly double quotes (U+201C, U+201D, U+201E, U+201F, U+2033) are read as `"` before `JSON.parse`; a certificate holds only ASCII values, so nothing valid changes. After Fast Refresh the same typed text was accepted ("certificado gravado", `04-ios-cert-ok.png`). `apps/app` has no test script, so there is no regression test; `standard` passes on the file.

## 4b. UI resilience

| Check | How | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Web, takeover (4000) | Draft "rascunho que deve sobreviver" in Publicar, then a second browser tab opened on the same URL | First tab: banner "outra aba assumiu a conexão" + "reconectar"; the draft still in the field. "reconectar" in the first tab: banner gone, draft intact; the second tab then showed the same banner |
| Web, server stopped | Draft extended, then `kill -INT` on varanda-serve | Banner "a conexão com o nó foi encerrada"; "reconectar" while the server was down: "não foi possível abrir a conexão com o varanda-serve", draft intact. varanda-serve restarted on the same data dir with `VARANDA_SERVE_TOKEN` set to the same token (the page keeps the token only in memory), then "reconectar": connected (`session.open` ok, `sync.status` idle), draft intact. Afterwards the security audit removed `VARANDA_SERVE_TOKEN` (a fixed token would keep a URL in the browser history valid across restarts): a restart now prints a new URL, which the page must be reopened with |
| iOS, node ends on its own | A temporary dev-only hook (removed afterwards, see below) ended the client side of the IPC 40 s after the first `launch()` of the JS context, the same path as a framing error from the node (`ipc.end()` then `finish()`), while a continuous sync was running (run 1) | The UI left the ready state: banner "a conexão com o nó foi encerrada" + "reconectar"; Sincronizar went from "sincronizando (contínuo, execução 1)" to "parado" with the lines cleared. "reconectar": a new `session.open` (a fresh worklet), the banner left, and "sincronizar uma vez" completed on the new node ("última execução 1: concluída") |
| Reply line | | "resposta a de74d3f3:2" in web A Rua and Diário; "resposta a de74d3f3:2" in iOS A Rua; "resposta a d28af364:3" in iOS Diário and web A Rua |
| iOS "DHT pública" with bootstrap entries | Conexão tab, bootstrap `127.0.0.1:49800` present, switch turned on | The switch applies in the form: the bootstrap field greys out and the notice "O nó vai usar a DHT pública da internet para achar pares." appears (`04b-ios-public-dht-toggle.png`). "aplicar e reiniciar o nó" was NOT pressed, so the node never joined the public DHT; the switch was turned off again. What submit would send was checked with the app's own `checkForm` in Node, with the same form: `{ bootstrap: null, dhtHost: "127.0.0.1", allowPublicDht: true }` (accepted; the raw form without the submit's bootstrap blanking gives "bootstrap e DHT pública são exclusivos"). The node-side acceptance of that config was not exercised |

Simulator note: with `simctl`-injected input, the first tap on a button right after typing into a TextInput was often swallowed and a second tap was needed; `Page` already sets `keyboardShouldPersistTaps='handled'`. Not reproduced by hand, so it is recorded as a harness observation, not a defect.

## 5. Leak checks

- **Browser (WebSocket frames).** After the page loaded, `window.WebSocket` was wrapped in the page (from the browser tool, not in the app source) and "reconectar" was pressed, so every later connection was captured: 2 connections, 85 frames, 52 inbound (responses and events: `sync.started`, `sync.event`, `sync.stopped`), covering every method the UI used (`session.open`, `sync.status`, `node.info`, `identity.create`, `identity.show`, `cert.add`, `profile.set`, `post.create`, `post.reply`, `follow.add`, `follow.list`, `sync.start`, `feed.read`, `log.read`). Scan of the inbound text: no string containing `/` (no filesystem path), no `secret`/`privateKey`/`primaryKey`, not the token, not the bootstrap port 49800 and not `127.0.0.1` (no DHT host). The only 128-hex value was `signature` of the member certificate in `log.read`, which is public block-0 data. The first connection (before the wrap: `session.open`, `sync.status`, `node.info`) was not captured; the same three calls were captured on the second connection. A separate scripted WebSocket client was not run.
- **iOS (IPC frames).** Temporary `console.log('[T11-FRAME] ' + JSON.stringify(obj))` in the frame decoder of `apps/app/src/client/native.js`, read through Metro's log (90 captured inbound frames, `05-ios-frames.log` in the scratchpad), then removed. Same scan: no `/` string (no `Documents` path or data dir), no secret key name, no bootstrap or DHT host; the only 128-hex value was the certificate `signature`. Metro may not forward every console line, so 90 is what was captured, not a proven total.
- **varanda-serve output.** Both runs printed exactly two lines; the token appears once, in the `abra ...#token=` line, and never again after startup (`grep -c` of the token = 1 per log).
- **Temporary code removed.** `apps/app/src/client/native.js` was restored from a copy taken before the edits: `git diff` shows no change to it, and `grep -rn T11 apps packages` finds nothing.

## Not verified

- Android native run (no SDK or Java on this Mac).
- Real devices (iOS or Android); only the iPhone 17 Pro simulator.
- The public DHT (never joined; see 4b).
- The node accepting a `allowPublicDht: true` config from the Conexão tab (would join the public DHT).
- A scripted WebSocket client acting like the page (the real page in a browser was used instead).
- The exit code of `seed` and `local-dht.js` on SIGINT in this run: they were stopped with `pkill -INT -f`, which also signalled their wrapper shells, so the wrapper reported 1. The demo covers the seeder's SIGTERM exit 0.

## Residual risks

- Everything in the "Residual risks" list of [ios-gate.md](ios-gate.md) still applies (Android unverified, fs facade TOCTOU, Bare version split between bare-kit and bare-runtime, linked addons wiped by every install, dev reload can take over a live lock).
- **Public DHT with a loopback DHT host.** Turning on "DHT pública" keeps the "endereço local da DHT" field (`127.0.0.1` here) in the config. The README warns that a loopback DHT host keeps the DHT away from public peers. The form does not clear or warn about it.
- **Stale notices.** Screen-local notices outlive the state they describe: "sincronização contínua iniciada" stays after the node ended and the sync state was reset; "publicado" stays on the Responder screen. Cosmetic.
- **Earlier app state.** The simulator still had a node and config from an earlier association; the app was uninstalled first. Changing association after an identity exists requires removing the app data by hand (by design: the association is read-only once an identity exists).

## Fixes made in this verification

- `apps/app/src/screens/Identidade.js`: curly double quotes typed by iOS smart punctuation are read as `"` before `JSON.parse` of the certificate (section 4).
- `docs/development.md`: the web export's output directory is stated (`apps/app/dist`, "Exported: dist") instead of "confirm the output directory".
- This file.

## Security audit fixes (after this verification)

The security audit of the branch (Claude and GPT; Grok's account was out of credit) found four verified issues, each rated high after triage. They were fixed after the checks above:

- **Android release signing** (`apps/app/android/app/build.gradle`): release builds were signed with the committed public debug keystore, so anyone could sign an "update" that reads the node's data. Release signing now comes only from `VARANDA_RELEASE_*` Gradle properties kept outside the repository, and a release build fails without them; debug builds use the `app.varanda.debug` application ID. Not built here (no Java).
- **Android backups** (`AndroidManifest.xml`, `app.json`): `allowBackup` was true, so the node's key material went to cloud backups. It is now false. Not built here.
- **iOS backups** (`apps/app/ios/Varanda/AppDelegate.swift`): `Documents/varanda` is marked as excluded from iCloud and device backups at launch. Checked on the iPhone 17 Pro simulator after a rebuild: `xattr -l` on the container's `Documents/varanda` shows `com.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem: com.apple.MobileBackup`, and `varanda-config.json` (not secret) is still backed up.
- **varanda-serve token** (`apps/cli/lib/serve/args.js`): a fixed `VARANDA_SERVE_TOKEN` would keep a URL left in the browser history valid across restarts. The variable is now refused and the token is generated on every start (`apps/cli/test/serve.test.js` covers both); the README advises a private window. This changes the 4b "server stopped" recovery: after a restart the page must be reopened with the new URL.
